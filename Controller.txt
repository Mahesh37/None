Controller:
1. Take outputs from classifier.
2. Priorities: 			: W : C
	Heavy vehicles		: 9 : 2
	Passenger Vehicles	: 5 : 3
	Bikes				: 2 : 5
3. Count the weight of each lane.
4. Lanes get priorities in order, more the weight, more the time.
5. Time calculation:
	Sum(No of Vehicles * W)/C
	
	Examples:
	
		DataSet:
			Heavy: 10
			Passenger: 5
			Bikes: 30
		Result:
			((10*9)+(5*5)+(2*30))/(7) = 25 Secs
		
		DataSet:
			Heavy: 22
			Passenger: 13
			Bikes: 5
		Result:
			((22*9)+(13*5)+(15*2))/2=151 Secs
			
		DataSet:
			Heavy: 2
			Passenger: 4
			Bikes: 40
		Result:
			((2*9)+(4*5)+(40*2))/5=23 Secs
			
		DataSet
			Heavy: 4
			Passenger: 21
			Bikes: 11
		Result:
			((4*9)+(21*5)+(11*2))/3 = 54 Secs
			
			
6. Assigning Time to Lanes Based on Clockwise Direction.
7. But if any Lane doesn't have any vehicles, that Lane will be eliminated.
8. Emergency Situations:
	- Pass the lane which has emergency vehicle.
	- Pass the same lane till it gets passed the traffic signal.
	- arduiNO HORN passes the message to front vehicles till it reaches the signal receiver.
		- It helps for long traffic lanes.
		- This message is not viewed by any vehicle user/driver.
		- This is activated when the emergency vehicle activates it.(Mostly Enabled)
		- It calculates the distance between the traffic signal and the emergency vehicle.
10. It stores the data into database
	- Video Streaming Backup.
	- Data related to Monitor log.
	- Realtime traffic patterns.
	- Officer control data.
	- Overriding Emergency patterns.
11. This Patterns can be used to predict future traffic based on the historic patternâ€™s.(Mentioned in PDF)
